# k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The notebook explores how KNN works and applies it to a dataset for classification or regression tasks.

## Features
- Explanation of the KNN algorithm
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of KNN from scratch and using `scikit-learn`
- Utilization of `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulrahmanRagab/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook knn.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells to execute the code and see the results.

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations and evaluation metrics to analyze the model's performance on a dataset. It compares different values of `k` and their impact on accuracy, using `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` to optimize hyperparameters.
