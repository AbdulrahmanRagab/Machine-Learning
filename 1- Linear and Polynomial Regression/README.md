## Repository Overview
This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that cover fundamental and advanced regression techniques in machine learning. Each notebook includes:
- Explanations of the theory behind the regression method.
- Step-by-step implementation in Python.
- Visualizations and evaluation metrics to analyze model performance.

## Notebooks
Hereâ€™s a list of the notebooks included in this repository:

1. **Simple Linear Regression.ipynb**
   - Demonstrates the implementation of simple linear regression with one independent variable.
   - Includes data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb**
   - Extends linear regression to multiple independent variables.
   - Covers feature selection, model training, and interpretation of coefficients.

3. **Polynomial Regression.ipynb**
   - Explains how to fit a polynomial regression model for non-linear data.
   - Includes two versions:
     - `4-1 Polynomial Regression.ipynb`: Basic polynomial regression.
     - `4-2 Polynomial Regression.ipynb`: Advanced polynomial regression with overfitting and underfitting analysis.

4. **Regularization-Ridge-Lasso-Elastic Net.ipynb**
   - Covers regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in regression models.
   - Includes Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net.
